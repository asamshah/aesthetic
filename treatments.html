		    <li class="header">Derma Fillers</li>
		    <li class="grey">Price <br><br>£165 for 0.5ml <br> £200 for 1ml</li>
		    <li>Duration 30-45 mins</li>
		    <li>Description<br><br>Dermal filler injections may be used in many areas of the face to fill and smooth lines, wrinkles, deep folds and to improve the appearance of scars.  They may also be used to restore and enhance the youthful curves of the face by adding volume to cheeks and lips and defining the natural contours of the jaw, chin and nose.</li>
		    <li>Process<br><br>Prior to your first treatment, our aesthetician will consult with you to assess your suitability for dermal filler 	and discuss any concerns or questions you may have.  
		    The procedure involves a small amount of the prescribed product being administered into the selected areas using a very fine needle, or in some instances, a cannula. The injections may sting for a few seconds, and in some instances a numbing agent will be used. </li>
		    <li>Results<br><br>Results are visible immediately and optimal in one to two weeks. They last six to twelve months, depending on the area treated and the product prescribed. The dermal filler will gradually and naturally degrade in the body. Regular treatments will help to maintain results.</li>
		    <li>Post Treatment<br><br>
		    Keep the injection site clean. 
		    Take anti-histamines as required to reduce swelling. 
		    Apply a cool compress to the site for ten minutes every hour, on the day of treatment but do not apply ice. 
		    Avoid facial treatments immediately after treatment.
		 		Avoid excessive exercise and exposure to heat for the first 24 hours

		    <li class="grey">Price <br><br>£180 for One Area <br> £200 for Two Areas <br>£250 for Three Areas </li>
		    <li>Duration 30-45 mins</li>
		    <li>Description<br><br>Anti–wrinkle injections are a powerful non-surgical treatment that smooths dynamic wrinkles and unwanted lines, resulting in a more youthful and rejuvenated appearance.</li>
		    <li>Process<br><br>Prior to your first treatment, our aesthetician will consult with you to assess your suitability for anti-wrinkle injections and discuss any concerns or questions you may have.
		The procedure involves a small amount of the prescribed product being administered into the selected facial muscle/s using a very fine needle. The injections may sting for a few seconds, but no anaesthetic is required.</li>
		    <li>Results<br><br>Anti-wrinkle injections contain botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) which relaxes and weakens the muscles that are responsible for wrinkles and frown lines.  
		Anti-wrinkle injections are used to treat the face, neck and décolletage and some areas of the body. Most people notice a difference after three days with optimum results visible at two weeks. Results typically last for three to four months. Regular treatments will help to maintain results.</li>
		    <li>Post Treatment<br><br>Avoid touching the injection sites for four hours  
		Avoid ‘facing-down’ or local pressure treatments (e.g. massage, facials, motorbike helmets, swimming goggles) for 12 hours. Avoid strenuous exercise and heat (e.g. saunas, LED) for 24 hours and avoid applying make up for 24 hours.</li>
